  </header>
  <section>
      <p>This privacy &amp; cookie policy ("App <strong>Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy</strong>") applies to the mobile application MyMedela Breastfeeding App ("<strong>App</strong>") which is operated and controlled by Medela AG, Lättichstrasse 4b, 6340 Baar, Switzerland ("<strong>Medela</strong>" or "</strong>we</strong>").</p>
      <p>This App Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy governs the collection, processing and use of your personal data, when you use our App, and explains our practices with respect to the placement of cookies, including the types of cookies we use and how you can manage them.</p>
      <p>App Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy last revised on July 1, 2020.</p>
  </section>
  <section>
      <h1>COLLECTION, PROCESSING AND USE OF YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h1>
      
      <h2>Registration &amp; Usage of our App</h2>
      <p>In order to use our App you must register an account with us. During the registration process you will be asked to provide certain information, such as your first name, email address and your baby's estimated or actual date of birth, and to choose a password. If you do not register an account you cannot use the App's contents.</p>
      <p>The registration process takes place via a protected server connection to Medela. Unless indicated otherwise in this App Privacy & Cookie Policy (in particular Section 1.3), we will use the personal data you reveal only as indicated in this App Privacy & Cookie Policy and to manage your account with us, store and collate your information on our servers (as necessary for the provision of our services), and to offer you the functionalities and services requested.</p>
      <p>Your data will not be shared with any third party and not be used for any purpose other than as indicated in this App Privacy & Cookie Policy, unless you have given your express prior consent.</p>
      <p>After registering, you are welcome to visit our App without revealing any further of your personal data. In this case, we will only collect certain anonymous information which does not directly relate to your person.</p>
      <p>By installing/starting our App and registering your account with us, you consent to Medela placing cookies on your device and/or using certain analysis tools to collect and analyse statistical information, such as user behavior, browsing patterns, average time period of use, and areas of interest. We collect and process this information to understand how our customers use our App, and to assess trends, statistics and our customers' needs, which help us to improve our App and to better serve our customers, which includes providing you with a more personalized App experience and targeted offers. Please see Sections 2, 2.4 and 2.5 below for a detailed description of the cookies and/or analysis tools we use for this purpose and your rights to opt-out. If you do not agree with the above practices and would like to fully avoid any tracking and collection of your information, even in anonymized form, please do not install the App on your device(s).</p>
      <p>For Android users only: When you connect our App with a bluetooth enabled Medela pump, the operating system requires access to the location (GPS) of the device. However, Medela does not store or use your location data at any time. Not allowing the location permission leads to problems with the connection of the pump.</p>

      <h2>Use of our App's Features</h2>
      <p>Our App offers different features where you can voluntarily decide to share further information with us. Such information includes personal data concerning both baby (e.g., name, picture, date of birth) and mother (e.g., expectations/experiences with breast feeding and pumping or expected education/job return date). Our App further enables you to track and monitor your breastfeeding and pumping schedule as well as your baby's weight, height, sleep, eating, and diaper changes. Finally, our App enables you to connect with our connected pumps to easily track and log session times, settings used, and record breast milk expressed, to receive reminder messages that keep you on track and notify you when your pump battery is low and to access live lactation support.</p>
      <p>Unless you have given your explicit consent, and unless indicated otherwise in this App Privacy & Cookie Policy (in particular Section 1.3), we will store, process and use such information only as necessary to enable your use of our functionalities and services, including to provide you through the App with personalized content, educational information, and helpful tips based on your unique data and progress.</p>
      <p>You may determine your areas of interest and/or alter your choices by changing your personalization settings in the App (More → Profile → Content → Personalisation) at any time. If you do not wish to receive any personalized content or services at all, you are free not to provide any personal information (and should abstain from completing the personalization questions in the App).</p>
      <p>You may further change your personal notification settings in the App (More → Preferences → Notifications) at any time.</p>
      <p>To enable you to upload a picture of your baby, our App will ask for the permission to access your camera/pictures. We will not use the permission granted other than as necessary for this purpose.</p>
      <p>Other than as explained above, we will further use any personal data we receive only in anonymized form (i.e., in a non-personally identifiable form which does not allow for any conclusions as to your identity) for statistical purposes and for internal evaluation to improve our products and services. Your data will not be processed for other purposes or beyond the scope of this Privacy Policy, except where expressly permitted or required by applicable law.</p>
     
      <h2>Creating one Single Record with Information from other Sources</h2>
      <p>In case you decide to use other services offered by us, such as where you register for a customer account on our Webshop Platform (as available under <a href="https://www.medela.us">www.medela.us</a>, <a href="https://www.medela.com">www.medela.com</a>, <a href="https:www.medela.de">www.medela.de</a>, <a href="https://www.medela.ch">www.medela.ch</a> (each including any subpages) and/or other Medela websites) or contact us with a specific request through our websites, we may create one single record for you which combines the data we receive from you through your use of these other services with the data we receive from you through your use of the App.</p>
      <p>This single record helps us to better understand your needs and preferences in order to more efficiently provide you with the requested products and services, including enabling you to benefit from a more personalized experience.</p>
      <p>In addition, <strong>in the United States</strong> by registering your account with us in the App we will automatically register you for The Mom’s Room which provides you free access to additional educational information and direct marketing communications about our products and services. By registering your account with us in the App you consent to this registration in The Mom’s Room and to receiving direct marketing communications relating to Medela products and services.</p>
      <p>Other than as indicated in this App Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy, we will not use the information for any other purposes or share the information with third parties, except where expressly permitted or required by applicable law.</p>

      <h1>COOKIES AND TRACKING &AMP; ANALYSIS TOOLS</h1>
      <h2>Essential Cookies</h2>
      <p>Cookies are small text files that our App asks to place on your tablet, smartphone or other device. If your device is set to accept cookies, then the text will be added in a small file on your mobile device. </p>
      <p>Except as indicated otherwise in this App Privacy &amp; Cookie Policy, the cookies used by us are essential for the functioning and performance of our App, such as by making our App work more efficiently and facilitating your use of the functionalities and services provided; these functionality and/or performance cookies will be deleted from your device once your browser-session has ended (session cookies). We will not use the information stored in essential cookies for any other purpose than as strictly necessary to provide you with the services and functionalities requested.</p>
    
      <h2>Consent to Placement of Non-Essential Cookies and Use of Analysis Tools</h2>
      <p>When you install/start our App and register your account with us, you consent to Medela placing additional cookies on your device and/or to Medela’s use of certain tracking and analysis tools. These cookies and tools will not be strictly necessary to ensure the functioning and performance of our App but will help us to collect some non-personalized information relating to your App usage behaviour in order to improve our App offering and services and/or to provide you with more personalized information and services, including providing you with targeted offers through our App (see also below Sections 2.4 and 2.5 for an explanation of certain tracking and analysis tools we use).</p>
      <p>You have the right to withdraw your consent and/or to individually opt-out from the placement of cookies and/or any collection of your information for the different purposes through the tracking and analysis tools at any time with effect for the future. For this purpose, please follow the instructions in Sections 2.3, 2.4 and 2.5 below. To completely withdraw your consent and to avoid any tracking and collection of your information, please delete the App from your device(s).</p>
     
      <h2>Managing your Cookie Settings</h2>
      <p>Most mobile devices are initially set to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can change your settings to generally refuse cookies, to delete cookies that have already been placed on your device, or to warn you before a cookie is placed. Please refer to your device instructions or to <a href="http://www.allaboutcookies.org/">www.allaboutcookies.org</a> to learn more about how to adjust or modify your mobile device settings.</p>
      <p>If you choose not to accept cookies, this may impair the usability of the App and you may not be able to take advantage of some of our features and services offered.</p>
      <p>If you use different mobile devices to access our App (e.g., smartphone, tablet, etc.) you will need to ensure that the settings on each device are adjusted to reflect your cookie preferences.</p>
    
      <h2>Use of Google Mobile App Analytics</h2>
      <p>This App uses Google Mobile App Analytics ("Google Analytics"), a web analytics service provided by Google Ireland Limited, Gordon House, 4 Barrow St, Dublin, D04 E5W5, Irland ("Google"). Google Analytics may use certain tracking technologies to help us analyze how users use our App, including the number of active users and user behavior (e.g., average time period of use, returning users, screen views per month, top 10 articles). As a rule, any information generated about your use of our App will be transmitted to and stored by Google on servers in the United States. Since this App has implemented the IP-anonymization functionality offered by Google, your IP address will, before being transferred to the US, be shortened by Google within the Member States of the European Union or in other contractual states of the Treaty on the European Economic Area. Only in exceptional cases your full IP address will be transferred to a server of Google in the US and be shortened there. </p>
      <p>Google will use this information as our commissioned data processor to help us evaluate the use of our App, to compile reports on App activity and to provide other statistical and analytical services relating to usage of our App. The IP address transmitted by your mobile device within the framework of Google Analytics will not be associated with any other data held by Google.</p>
      <p>If you do not wish to be tracked by Google Analytics you can opt-out at any time by deleting the App from your mobile device.</p>

      <h2>Use of App Analytics Tools</h2>
      <p>Medela further uses certain app analytics tools and services to gather aggregated and anonymized statistical information about the usage of our App.</p>
      <p>We use iTunes Connect App Analytics provided by Apple, Inc. ("<strong>Apple</strong>"). This tool collects anonymized and aggregated data from app users on mobile Apple devices using iOS 8 or higher. iTunes Connect App Analytics provides us with metric App usage data, such as the total number of times the App has been installed, the number of times the app has been used, and the number of active sessions within a specific period. </p>
      <p>We further use similar analytics and statistics services provided by Google Inc. ("<strong>Google</strong>") through the Google Play Developer Console. The information we receive only includes aggregated and anonymized statistical information from app users on Android devices, such as install and upgrade numbers, crash numbers, user ratings, acquisition channels, and visitor regions.</p>
      <p>If the respective feature is enabled on your device, Apple or Google (respectively) will collect, process and use such information to help us evaluate the use of our App, to compile reports on App activity and to provide other statistical and analytical services relating to the usage of our App.</p>
      <p>We only receive the above information if you have opted-in to share your data with third-party providers on your mobile device. You can make and alter your choice (opt-in or opt-out) at any time in the settings menu of your device (for iOS devices see: Settings → Privacy → Diagnostics &amp; Usage; for Android devices see Settings → User and backup → Google → More → Usage &amp; diagnostics).</p>
